                                I have a passion and deep interest for designing and developing applications 
                                that are not only functional and extremely helpful for everyday use, but also 
                                assist me in furthering my skills and talents as a developer. I take pride in 
                                continuously learning and researching new methods and practices that can both 
                                improve the quality of my projects, as well as my abilities.

                                I want to solve in my every-day life, as well as spending time studying data structures 
                                and algorithms. I prioritize making sure that I improve day by day.

                                In the past couple years, Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of gaining a multitude of experience 
                                in both my time earning my degree at Michigan State University and working under the company 
                                Ally Financial. When i'm not studying Leetcode or working on project code, some of my favorite
                                hobbies are gaming, reading, chess, and exercising at the gym!
